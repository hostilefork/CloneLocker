 * user mode components, hence there cannot be things in this

 * made by kernel mode vs the user mode.

 * In the scanner example I was looking at, the notificiation came

 * was in the spirit of a virus scanner or similar and was looking for
 * words in the file and refusing to open it if those words were in the
 * contents.  ClientLocker isn't (currently) based on locking any file
 * *contents* at all, it only looks at file *names*.  And if the file
 * is already taken by the network it opens the file itself (and it has
 * a special exclusion to do so based on process ID).  So there
 * isn't any information to reply to the driver with.  But if there
 * were it would be here.
 *
 * To sum all that up: "SafeToOpen" was a boolean from the scanner
 * example, but it's currently ignored.
