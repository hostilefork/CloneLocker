// Don't underestimate this line.  I got it from the DDK sample for

// course, but I will remind anyone who isn't familiar that all
// #pragma directives exist outside of the language standard.
// Someone on the GCC team apparently took this idea of compiler-defined
// behavior to an extreme and if you used any pragmas the compiler
// would launch a game of Tetris.  Because well, it is up to the
// compiler how to handle them.  But this totally can muck up the
// interactions between the kernel mode component and user mode
// component.  I have reached a delicate balance by putting it...here
// (if it is needed at all).  I'm not on a timescale where I can 
// really experiment with understanding well enough if I can take 
// it out, this is what we call "copypasta" code.  And the NT DDK
// has samples that I will call a disgrace to programming.
